THE TASK:

#### Team registration and project proposal

After registration, each team will be assigned a new private Github repository for the project. By the project proposal deadline, the team should have pushed the proposal to their project repository. The proposal will take the form of a README.md file at the root of your project repository on Github. This file should be properly formatted in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

To receive full credits, the proposal should contains the following information:

- project Title 
    - Hexa-Game

- team Members 
    - Lakshmi (Sai) Oduri
    - Lors Kushtov
    - Hao Yang (Frank) Xu

- a description of web application 
    - The web application will be a game created with the ReactJS library. It will be a turn based strategy game played on a grid. The objective of the game is to defeat the opponent by controlling more hexagons (positions). The player with the most  hexagons at the end of the game, wins. The idea is to have each player clone/jump their hexagons 1 or 2 positions, which then will take over all positions adjacent to the cloned/jumped spot. The front end will be completely connected, so players can click on positions which make the API calls.

- a description of the key features that will be completed by the Beta version 
    - Single player, turn by turn 
    - User authentication with profiles done 
    - Ability to preform clones and jumps with the front end.

- a description of additional features that will be complete by the Final version 
    - Multiplayer turn-by-turn 
    - Able to declare winner/loser
    - Game stats saved for user

- a description of the technology that you will use 
    - React JS
    - Graphic apis 
    - WebRTC for P2P communications between browsers (react-webrtc package to use with react)
    - 2D game

- a description of the top 5 technical challenges 
    - Learning and utilizing the ReactJS library
    - Implementing the front-end React with the back-end MongoDB
    - Learning and utilizing Socket IO
    - Multiplayer (Sync two or more sessions together to be able to play at the same time)
    - Making the game with nice 2D graphics having multiple sprites moving on one grid
