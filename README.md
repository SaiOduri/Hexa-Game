### WHAT IS Hexa-Game?

Hexa-game is a turn by turn, strategy game we developed for a class project. We made this using React, MongoDB, Node, Express and Socket.IO. 

The game is hosted live at hexxagame.herokuapp.com. You will need to login with your google account, and wait for another player. If you want to play by yourself, then you will need to be logged in with two different google accounts (use Incognito).

### HOW DO YOU PLAY?

The game is played turn by turn and the ruby player starts. Users play by clicking one of their hexagons, on their turn and selecting a position to move to.

This is what the game looks like at the start:
<img src="ruby jumps.png" alt="test" width = "100%">

#### Goal
In order to win, the goal is to control more hexagons. Players have the options to either clone or jump their hexagons.
#### Cloning
Cloning (green spots) - This option allows the user to duplicate their hexagon into the selected position.
#### Jumping
Jumping (yellow spots) - This option will not duplicate the hexagon, instead will jump it to selected position.
#### Taking Over Enemy Hexagons
After players perform a clone or jump, they will take over all enemy hexagons surrounding the cloned/jumped spot. This is where most of the strategy lies!

### THE END

Overall this was a great project! Hope you guys enjoyed it!
